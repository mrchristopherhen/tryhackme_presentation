# ðŸŽ¤ TryHackMe Presentation â€” Endpoint Security

---

## ðŸ“‹ Overview
This respository contains the material from my oral presentation on Endpoint Security, delivered as part of my cybersecurity coursework.
The presentation exlores how attackers exploit endpoints, and how defenders fight back.

It draws hands-on labs from TryHackMe, blending technical insights from real-world threat scenarios to demonstrate how knowledge, awareness, and the right tools make all the difference.
